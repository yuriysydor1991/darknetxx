# Project structure

For a description of the already available components, their class structure and
their purpose see the
[Project components and architecture](/doc/sections/en_US/3-components-and-architecture.md)
section.

## Implement code straight away!

To proceed the application implementation right away look for the `Application` class' `Application.cpp` file which is designed to accept initial code of the application. Specifically, new code may be placed into the `int Application::run(std::shared_ptr<ApplicationContext> ctx)` method.

**But do not forget about the SOLID principles and code decomposing!**

It's preferable to create other directories which would contain implemented components of the application and include them into the `Application` class implementation, rather than put all the code inside the `Application` class itself.

## Changing the project and executable name

Change the name of the project in the project's root `CMakeLists.txt` file by introducing a new value for the the `PROJECT_NAME` and/or `PROJECT_BINARY_NAME` variable which is located at `cmake/template-project-misc-variables-declare.cmake`. It is recommended to do so the executable will represent your new application name instead of templated default one - the `darknetxx`.

## Introducing custom command line parameters

In order to introduce some additional command line parameters for the binary look for the `CommandLineParser` class implementation. It contains command line parsing routines that are passed by `ApplicationFactory` class after the `main` function was called.

Add some additional custom fields into the `ApplicationContext` class in order to pass some custom command line flags and/or data to the `IApplication` interface abstract class descendants that will be created by the `ApplicationFactory` during command line arguments parse.

After registering a new flag in the `CommandLineParser`, also register it in the `ApplicationHelpPrinter` class so that the `--help`/`-h` output keeps representing all the available command line parameters. The flag string constants themselves are kept in a single place - the `CMDParamNames` class - and are referenced by both the parser and the help printer.

See the [Available command line parameters](/doc/sections/en_US/5-run-the-executable.md#available-command-line-parameters) section for the full list of the parameters that the default implementation already supports.

## Implement your own IApplication descendants

You may implement another custom `IApplication` descendant classes in order to support high level variety of the application behavior to not to mess original `Application` class with irrelevant `if`-s statements and mixing up code (remember about the SOLID's single responsibility principle).

You may accomplish `IApplication` subclassing by directly creating an `IApplication` subclass in a new file or extend existing `IApplication` descendant like `Application`, `ApplicationHelpPrinter` or a `ApplicationVersionPrinter`.

Register newly created custom `IApplication` descendant in the `ApplicationFactory`'s `create_application` method which is responsible to create appropriate application instance with accordance of a provided data through the command line parameters.

That may be accomplished by implementing a custom `ApplicationFactory` descendant and overriding it's create methods like `create_application` and/or others (call appropriate static member in the `main` function of the `main.cpp` file).

## Version tracking and other project parameters

The project's `CMakeLists.txt` files are tracking of a current project git repository commit, project name, configure date and projects version that are forwarded into the projects's configure header file located at `src/app/project-global-decls.h.in`. The `project-global-decls.h.in` will be compiled into the build directory as `project-global-decls.h`. The `ApplicationVersionPrinter` class includes this project's configure file and uses the information provided to print appropriate version info. Usually, this code is executed by calling generated executable with a `-v` or `--version` command line flag. After the version is printed, the default implementation cause the application's `ApplicationVersionPrinter` instance to return zero value and cause the executable to stop it's execution.

## Project tests

Project already contains some simple test samples. Based on them you may implement full test of the introduced code. 

See the [Project build](/doc/sections/en_US/4-project-build.md) subsection to enable unit testing with CMake.

### Google Test

Currently test samples are based on the GTest framework. GTest framework by itself becomes available by the `FetchContent_Declare`/`FetchContent_MakeAvailable` CMake-commands if no system GTest is available. 

Of course, the project's CMakeLists.txt files are probing the GTest only if tests are enabled by `ENABLE_UNIT_TESTS` CMake variable. System GTest probe may be turned OFF by setting appropriate value to the `GTEST_TRY_SYSTEM_PROBE` CMake variable.

Look for a `cmake/template-project-GTest-enabler.cmake` to see details or change GTest version etc.

## Extensions

There will be introduced some other standard project features in the future.
